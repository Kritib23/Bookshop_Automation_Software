# Bookshop Automation Software GUI

The Bookshop Automation Software is a graphical user interface application developed using the Python Tkinter library. It automates various activities of a small book shop, providing an intuitive interface for users to interact with the system.

## Features

- **User Login**: The application includes a login page where users can select their login type, such as a manager, owner, sales clerk, or customer of the book shop. This ensures personalized access to relevant functionalities based on user roles.

- **Book Search**: Customers can utilize the search functionality to find and purchase books available in the shop. They can search for books based on title, author, genre, or any other relevant criteria. This feature enables customers to quickly locate their desired books and make a purchase.

- **Book Availability**: The search functionality also allows customers to generate requests if a desired book is not currently available. This feature ensures that customers can express their interest in a book and allows the shop to manage customer requests efficiently.

- **Inventory Management**: Employees, such as managers and sales clerks, have access to an inventory update feature. This allows them to add new books, update existing book details, and remove books that are no longer in stock. By keeping the inventory up to date, the shop ensures that the collection remains relevant for customers.

- **Software Requirements Specification (SRS)**: The project includes a well-defined Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document that outlines the functional and non-functional requirements of the Book Shop Management GUI. This document serves as a reference for the development team and stakeholders to ensure a clear understanding of the system's scope and objectives.

- **Unit Test Plan**: To ensure the reliability and quality of the application, a comprehensive unit test plan has been implemented. This plan covers various functionalities and scenarios to validate the correctness and robustness of the system. Performing unit tests helps identify and resolve any issues or bugs in the software.
